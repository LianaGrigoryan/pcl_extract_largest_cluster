# PCL Extract Largest Cluster

This is a tool to perform euclidean cluster extraction in parallel. It can be used to extract the largest cluster in the point cloud. This is particularly useful if there are a large number of files to be performed. It utilises the number of hardware threads to perform the process in parallel, and so can efficiently process large numbers of files.

## Installation

Requires PCL 1.7, C++14 compatible compiler, Boost.

Run cmake, make.
